   <h1>history of dagadushet</h1><hr>
   <p><b>Nanasaheb Priviwale of Pune </b>witnessed the Ganpati festival in Valher, inspiring him to unite society for freedom. He introduced the concept in Pune, initially met with resistance due to the city's conservative reputation. Lokamanya Tilak convened a meeting, inviting <strong>Dagdusheth Halwai</strong>, the <mark> of Pune, and Mayavars</mark>. They decided to celebrate the seven-day Ganpati festival at five city locations, with locals funding it. The response was so positive that Lokamanya Tilak urged the public to join, leading to a ten-day celebration in 1893.<i> Dagdusheth Halwai</i> introduced an environmentally-friendly idol, differing from traditional warrior Ganesha forms. This concept aimed to bless and protect society. Shri Naik crafted this idol, which became the symbol of the <em>Dagdusheth Halwai</em> <u>Ganpati Trust's Ganesh Utsav</u>.</p>

   <p><h1>Raigad fort</h1><hr><b>Rajgad, meaning “King of Forts,”</b> rightfully earned its name due to its pivotal role in shaping Maratha history. Originally known as Murumbdev, it was captured by <i>Shivaji Maharaj</i> in 1647, who transformed it into a formidable stronghold. For over 26 years, this fort served as the capital of the Maratha Empire before shifting to Raigad Fort in 1674.

Several major historical events unfolded here, including the birth of Rajaram I, Shivaji’s son, and the demise of Saibai, his beloved wife. It was also the fort where Shivaji planned many of his military campaigns and safeguarded the wealth looted from Surat in 1664. Despite relentless attacks from <mark>Mughals and Adilshahi forces,</mark> Rajgad stood unconquered, a testament to its impenetrable defenses.
Rajgad Fort stands as a masterpiece of medieval architecture, spanning an impressive 40 kilometers in base diameter and rising 1,376 meters above sea level. This historic stronghold is divided into distinct sections, each playing a crucial role in its strategic defense and administration.

At the heart of the fort lies Padmavati Machi, which once served as Shivaji Maharaj’s residence. This section houses the Padmavati Temple, the Padmavati Lake, and the ruins of ancient palaces, reflecting the grandeur of its past. Additionally, it functioned as an important military post, making it the nerve center of the fort.

To the west, Sanjivani Machi showcases brilliant military engineering with its three-layered fortification, designed to withstand enemy invasions. This structure highlights the tactical genius of the Marathas, ensuring multiple defensive lines against attackers.
