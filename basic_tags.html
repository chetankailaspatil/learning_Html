    <pre>Rajgad Fort stands as a masterpiece of medieval architecture, spanning an impressive 40 kilometers in base diameter and rising 1,376 meters above sea level. This historic stronghold is divided into distinct sections, each playing a crucial role in its strategic defense and administration.

At the heart 

    of the fort lies 
    
    Padmavati Machi, which once served as Shivaji Maharajâ€™s residence. This section houses the Padmavati Temple, the Padmavati Lake, and the ruins of ancient palaces, reflecting the grandeur of its past. Additionally, it functioned as an important military post, making it the nerve center of the fort.
